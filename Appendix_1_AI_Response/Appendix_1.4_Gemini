In the next 10 years, we can expect to see new gravitational wave detectors come online, which will allow us to study these events in more detail and learn more about the fundamental nature of gravity.
•	Dark matter and dark energy: Dark matter and dark energy are two of the biggest mysteries in physics. Dark matter makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe, but we don't know what it is made of.

In the next 10 years, we can expect to see new experiments and theoretical advances that will shed light on these mysteries.
•	Unification of the forces of nature: The Standard Model of particle physics is the most successful theory in physics, but it does not explain everything. For example, it does not unify the four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force, and the weak force. In the next 10 years, we can expect to see new theories and experiments that aim to unify the forces and complete the Standard Model.

Q2:
•	Direct imaging of an exoplanet: This has been a long-standing goal of astronomers, and it is now getting closer to reality. New instruments, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), are expected to be able to directly image exoplanets, which would allow us to learn more about their atmospheres and compositions. 
•	Detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime, and they were first detected in 2015. In the next 10 years, we can expect to detect more gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars, which will give us new insights into these exotic objects. 
•	Measurement of the dark energy equation of state: Dark energy is a mysterious force that is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. By measuring the dark energy equation of state, we can learn more about the nature of dark energy and its role in the universe. 
•	Discovery of new types of black holes and neutron stars. Black holes and neutron stars are some of the most extreme objects in the universe. In the next 10 years, we can expect to discover new types of black holes and neutron stars, which will challenge our understanding of these objects and their formation. 
•	Detection of biosignatures on exoplanets. Biosignatures are molecules or other signs that could indicate the presence of life on a planet. In the next 10 years, we can expect to detect biosignatures on exoplanets, which would be the strongest evidence yet for life beyond Earth. 

Q3:
•	Quantum computing: Quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers. Nanoscience is essential for developing quantum computers because it allows us to create and manipulate the tiny components that make them up. In the next 10 years, we could see quantum computers become powerful enough to solve some of the world's most challenging problems, such as drug discovery and materials science.
•	Nanomedicine: Nanomedicine is the use of nanotechnology to improve human health. Nano scientists are developing new ways to deliver drugs, diagnose diseases, and repair damaged tissues. In the next 10 years, we could see nanomedicine become a routine part of healthcare, with new treatments for cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other serious conditions.
•	Molecular manufacturing: Molecular manufacturing is the ability to build complex structures atom by atom. Nanoscience is essential for developing molecular manufacturing because it allows us to create and manipulate the tiny tools and machines that would be needed. In the next 10 years, we could see the first molecular manufacturing machines being built, which could revolutionize the way we manufacture products.
•	New materials: Nanoscience is helping us to develop new materials with extraordinary properties. For example, nano scientists have created materials that are stronger, lighter, and more conductive than anything that existed before. In the next 10 years, we could see new materials being developed with even more amazing properties, which could lead to new products and technologies in a wide range of industries.

Q4:
•	Quantum photonics: Quantum photonics is a rapidly growing field that harnesses the power of quantum mechanics to control light in new and unprecedented ways.

This technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including telecommunications, computing, and healthcare. In the next 10 years, we can expect to see significant advances in integrated photonics, such as the development of integrated photonic chips that can perform complex optical functions at a fraction of the cost and size of traditional optical devices
•	Metamaterials: Metamaterials are artificial materials that have optical properties that are not found in nature. Metamaterials have the potential to be used to create new and innovative photonic devices, such as cloaking devices and invisibility cloaks. In the next 10 years, we can expect to see significant advances in the development and fabrication of metamaterials, leading to the development of new photonic devices with unprecedented capabilities.

Q5:
•	Unifying the fundamental forces of nature. The Standard Model of particle physics has been incredibly successful in describing the fundamental forces and particles of nature, but it is incomplete. Physicists are working on theories that could unify the Standard Model with the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity, to create a unified theory of all forces.
•	Understanding dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter and dark energy make up most of the matter and energy in the universe, but we still don't know what they are. Physicists are working on both theoretical and experimental approaches to understanding these mysterious substances.

Physicists are developing new algorithms and applications for quantum computers to study problems in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and other areas of physics.

Q6:
•	FLASH radiotherapy: This new type of radiation therapy delivers radiation at ultrahigh dose rates, which is thought to spare healthy tissue while still effectively killing cancer cells. The first clinical trials of FLASH radiotherapy are currently underway, and physicists are working to develop new technologies to make it more widely available. 
•	Proton therapy: Proton therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses protons instead of X-rays to kill cancer cells. Protons are more precise than X-rays, which can reduce damage to healthy tissue. Physicists are working to make proton therapy more affordable and accessible to patients. 
•	Photon-counting multispectral X-ray imaging: This new type of X-ray imaging uses novel photon-counting detectors to look at the properties of every single photon received after having passed through a patient's body. This could provide much more detailed and informative images than current X-ray technologies. 
•	Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging: AI is being used to develop new tools for analysing medical images more quickly and accurately. This could help doctors to diagnose diseases earlier and more effectively. 
•	Deep brain stimulation (DBS): DBS is a surgical procedure that involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical stimulation to specific areas. DBS has been used to treat a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. Physicists are working to develop new DBS devices that are more precise and effective. 
•	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): TMS is a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain.
